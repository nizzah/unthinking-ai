# **Product Requirements Document (PRD) \- Unthinking App**

**Version:** 2.0  
 **Owner:** Nirish Shakya  
 **Parent Brand:** Unthinking Space  
 **Tagline:** *Find a piece of yourself every time you open the app.*  
 **Date:** October 2025

## **1\. Purpose**

Unthinking App is a meaning-tech product that helps accomplished yet restless professionals turn moments of mental or creative stuckness into small, meaningful motion.

It turns overthinking into gentle action by surfacing one spark of clarity from their own notes, reflections, or saved content, then guiding them through a single 2-5 minute step that feels light, playful and true.

Each use delivers clarity, relief and confidence \- restoring self-trust in the quietest possible way. Over time, users rediscover a simple truth: they already have what they need to move forward.

**Core Promise:** 

Trust yourself again. One spark of clarity, one small step of courage, one moment of meaning.

## **2\. Positioning**

Unthinking is the first Meaning-Tech product \- a tool that doesn’t just save time or make users feel better, but makes time matter. It goes beyond awareness and acceleration into existential alignment.

It’s technology designed not to make people more productive or peaceful, but more *aligned*.

Where most tools focus on optimisation and output, Unthinking helps users reclaim meaning \-  connecting reflection, emotion, and action in a single daily ritual.

It’s built on the principles of calm design (minimal, humane, non-addictive), yet its purpose runs deeper:  to help people rediscover *why they do what they do* \- and act on it, one spark at a time.

## **3\. Problem Statement**

Modern high-achievers are silently burning out behind polished success. They’re stuck on autopilot \- impressing others rather than expressing themselves. They have ideas but are too afraid to act, afraid to lose the status and lifestyle they’ve worked so hard to earn. The salary and title keep the discomfort tolerable, even as years slip by. They’ve been thinking about change for years but don’t know where to begin. They keep learning, planning, and collecting insights \- yet rarely act on them. 

They face:

* **Information overload:** Endless learning with no integration or application.

* **Decision fatigue:** Too many ideas, no clarity on where to start.

* **Creative fear:** Worry that their ideas aren’t good enough or will fail publicly.

* **Emotional exhaustion:** A constant background hum of guilt, anxiety, and self-doubt.

* **Loss of self-trust:** They’ve outsourced their intuition to systems, gurus, and algorithms.

Existing tools \- from journals to productivity apps \- focus on adding and doing more. None help users use what they already know and act on things that truly matter to them.

Unthinking bridges that gap: a calm, humane system that turns stuck moments into self-led movement, one spark and one step at a time.

## **5\. Core User Persona**

### **The Awakening Achiever \- “Successful outside, stuck inside.”**

**Profile Summary**

The Awakening Achiever is a mid-career professional, designer, or creative who has checked all the boxes of success \- steady job, reputation, stability \- but quietly feels trapped in auto-pilot. They long to create, express, or start something meaningful, yet fear, self-doubt, and overthinking keep them from taking the first step. They spend hours collecting insights, journaling, or planning side projects that never leave their notes app.

**In short:** they know there’s more in them, but they don’t trust themselves enough to act on it.

**Psychological Snapshot**

| Dimension | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Surface life** | Accomplished, responsible, outwardly confident. |
| **Inner world** | Restless, unfulfilled, afraid of wasting their potential. |
| **Core conflict** | “I’ve built the life I was supposed to \- but it no longer feels like mine.” |
| **Avoidance loop** | Overthinking → Over-researching → Paralysis → Busyness. |
| **Core desire** | To feel alive, courageous, and creative again \- without blowing everything up. |

**Primary challenges**

1. **Creative courage gap**

2. **Meaningful side-path paralysis**  
   Dreams of exploring a side business, passion, or creative hobby but overthinks every detail and fears wasting time or failing publicly.

3. **Auto-pilot fatigue**  
   Runs on routines that no longer bring joy. Mistakes exhaustion for productivity. Feels guilty for wanting change.

**Core needs**

* A safe, fast way to reconnect with their own voice and instincts.

* Gentle permission to take small, low-risk experiments.

* A structure that feels calm and kind \- not another to-do system.

* Proof that their intuition can be trusted.

**Emotional trigger**

“I’m tired of thinking about the life I want and never acting on it.”

**Desired outcomes**

* Regain creative energy and self-trust through daily micro-actions.

* Feel lighter, clearer, and more confident after each session.

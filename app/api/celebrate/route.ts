**USER'S JOURNEY:**
Mind dump: "${mindDump}"
Spark insight: "${sparkInsight}"
Tiny action they took: "${selectedStep}" (${selectedDuration} minutes)

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- Make each celebration SPECIFICALLY about their journey, emotions, and insights
- Use their exact words, themes, and emotional state from their mind dump
- Reference their spark insight and tiny action in creative ways
- Make them feel like a personal party just for them
- Be playful, quirky, and unexpected - avoid generic advice
- Each should feel like a mini-adventure tailored to their story
- Use fun, energetic language that matches their vibe
- Include specific details from their session

**EXAMPLES OF PERSONALIZATION:**
- If they wrote about work stress â†’ "Do a power pose and declare 'I'm unstoppable!' like the boss you are"
- If they mentioned creativity â†’ "Sketch a tiny doodle of your spark insight on your hand"
- If they felt overwhelmed â†’ "Do a silly dance that shakes off all that mental clutter"
- If they wrote about relationships â†’ "Send yourself a love text with your own phone number"

**FORMAT:**
Return ONLY a JSON array:
[
  { "duration": 1, "activity": "ðŸŽ‰ [wildly personalized 1-minute celebration]" },
  { "duration": 2, "activity": "ðŸŒŸ [quirky 2-minute celebration]" },
  { "duration": 5, "activity": "âœ¨ [epic 5-minute celebration]" }
]

Make these celebrations feel like they were created specifically for this person's unique story!`

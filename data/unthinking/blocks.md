# Unthinking App - Blocks

## Common Blocks & Inner Patterns

### 1. Overthinking Loop
"I keep analysing and planning but never start."
- Feels safe in research and preparation.
- Avoids uncertainty by endlessly refining ideas.
**Reframe:** Start badly on purpose. Clarity comes through motion.

### 2. Creative Self-Doubt
"I'm afraid my work won't be good enough."
- Tied to identity and fear of judgment.
- Paralysis disguised as perfectionism.
**Reframe:** Treat the first attempt as a sketch, not a performance.

### 3. Fear of Visibility
"I don’t want to be seen failing."
- Keeps ideas private; waits for confidence to appear first.
**Reframe:** Confidence is a side-effect of small public experiments.

### 4. Decision Fatigue
"So many ideas—I can’t choose one."
- Believes one wrong choice could waste years.
**Reframe:** Any path walked with attention reveals meaning.

### 5. Guilt Around Rest
"I feel bad when I’m not productive."
- Equates stillness with laziness.
**Reframe:** Rest is a creative act; recovery is progress.

### 6. Loss of Self-Trust
"I keep outsourcing my intuition to experts and algorithms."
- Looks for certainty outside instead of inside.
**Reframe:** Evidence of trust builds through tiny self-led actions.

### 7. Autopilot Living
"Every day feels the same, but I don’t know how to stop."
- Life driven by obligation, not curiosity.
**Reframe:** Disrupt routine gently—add one moment of wonder a day.

### 8. Emotional Exhaustion
"I’m tired, but can’t justify slowing down."
- Feels disconnected from joy and meaning.
**Reframe:** Energy returns when actions serve what matters, not what impresses.

### 9. Fear of Starting Small
"If it’s not life-changing, it’s not worth starting."
- Holds out for grand transformation.
**Reframe:** Five-minute steps shift momentum faster than big plans.

### 10. Avoidance of Discomfort
"I know what to do but can’t make myself do it."
- Avoids temporary discomfort that leads to growth.
**Reframe:** Courage feels like discomfort at first; relief follows after.
